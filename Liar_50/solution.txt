The secret file is actually a zip archive, which we can extract to get a png file.
However, the png is not a valid png, due to missing header bytes. Every valid png
begins the following bytes:

    89 50 4e 47 0d 0a 1a 0a

However, our png begins with these bytes:

    0d 0a 1a 0a 00 00 00 0d

Replace the missing bytes using a hex editor or something to get the flag.
